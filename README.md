# Solidity Smart Contracts Repository

Welcome to the Solidity Smart Contracts repository! This repository contains a collection of simple smart contracts, including the MyToken contract, which is an implementation of a basic token contract using the ERC20 standard.

## Contracts Included

### MyToken

- *Contract Name*: MyToken
- *Version*: 1.0.0
- *License*: UNLICENSED
- *Solidity Version*: 0.8.18

#### Project Description

The MyToken contract is an ERC20-compatible token contract designed to facilitate minting and burning operations. It encompasses the following functionalities:

- **Minting:** Users can create new tokens, effectively increasing the total token supply.
- **Burning:** Tokens can be destroyed (burned), leading to a reduction in the total token supply.
- **Balance Tracking:** The contract diligently monitors token balances across various addresses.

#### Usage of Project

To deploy the MyToken contract, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open MyToken.sol:** Use a Solidity development environment such as Remix to open the MyToken.sol file.

3. **Compile the Contract:** Ensure that you compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.18 or any compatible version.

4. **Deploy the Compiled Contract:** After compilation, deploy the compiled contract to any Ethereum-compatible blockchain network of your choice.

5. **Interact with Contract Functions:**
   - **mint(address _address, uint _value):** Use this function to mint new tokens and assign them to the specified address.
   - **burn(address _address, uint _value):** Utilize this function to burn (destroy) tokens from the specified address if the balance is sufficient.

For more detailed information, including usage examples and function parameters, please refer to the code and comments provided within the MyToken.sol file.

## Contribution
